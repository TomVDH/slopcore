# Shading — canonical record (NAIL IT DOWN)

The dither shading is the heart of tomfolio. **This file is the source of truth for the
current shader state, and every shading change MUST be logged here in the same commit.**
Miss nothing: uniforms (name · units · default · range · meaning), palettes, cursor modes,
and the reveal / develop / crossfade / motion behaviours.

> Units rule: the **same unit for the same concept**, everywhere. Cell density is always a
> *cell count* (`uCell`, `uDevCell`); polarity is always `uInvert`; etc. No multipliers where
> a sibling control uses absolute counts.

## Files + lockstep

- **Shader:** `src/directions/press/art.ts` — the `pressFrag` template string. The only place
  the GLSL lives; reused by the rig, letterpress, the press direction, and the artefact.
- **Uniform defaults:** `src/gl/scene.ts` (the `uniforms` object) + `setImage` / `setImage2`.
- **Palettes — FOUR lockstep locations** (same count + order; currently **54**):
  1. the shader `uColorway` if-chain (`art.ts`)
  2. `PALETTES` (`art.ts`)
  3. `COLORS` (`src/sandbox/artefact.ts`)
  4. the rig `uColorway` select `options` (`src/sandbox/rig.ts`)

## Uniform inventory

| `uMarkBright` | gain | 0 | −1–1 | brightness of the dither **mark** colour, applied AFTER quantise (never alters the dither pattern) and scaled by the mark's own **root** value `+ uMarkBright·sqrt(value)` per channel — lifts bright marks, leaves shadows; distinct from `uImageBrightness` (source) |

| `uImageContrast` | mult | 1 | 0.1–5 | image contrast around mid (before invert + threshold) |
| `uInvert` | bool | 0 | 0/1 | polarity flip, **duotone only** (full-colour never inverts — a colour negative reads as wrong colour). Resolved (in `artefact.ts`) from the Invert control: Off=0, On=1, **Auto** (default) = invert when `paperLum < inkLum` (dark-paper stock). The Invert + Auto rows hide while Full colour is on |
| `uFadeMode` | enum | 2 | 0–2 | edge dissolve: 0 off, 1 simple radial, 2 cloud. Applied **through the Bayer dither** (`step(bayer4(cellId), cov)`) — cells drop in dither order, stippling the fade into the marks rather than an alpha overlay |

| `uReveal` | 0–1 | 0 | 0–1 | crossfade dither → true-colour photo (natural light); cell ramps up |
| `uImageState` | bool | 0 | 0/1 | dev: show the undithered adjusted source |
| `uCursorView` | bool | 0 | 0/1 | dev: show raw cursor influence `infl` as grayscale (white = peak, black = none) — reveals ellipse shape + orientation |
| `uCursorMode` | enum | 1 | 0–5 | 0 Off, 1 Clear, 2 Ink, 3 Bias, 4 Negative, 5 Develop |

| `uDevStage` | 0–1 | 0.45 | 0–1 | Develop **Stage**: press point where the finer dither ramps in |
| `uDevResolve` | 0–1 | 1 | 0–1 | Develop **Resolve**: how fully a full press replaces the base marks with the fine dither (0 none, 1 full) |
| `uDevSat` | mult | 1 | 0–4 | Develop **Saturation** of the dithered colour (0 gray, >1 boost) |
| `uDevSharp` | 0–3 | 0 | 0–3 | Develop **Pop**: 4-tap unsharp / local-contrast boost in the develop region |
| `uDevBright` | offset | 0 | −1–1 | Develop's own brightness, on top of the image grade, applied to the develop source before re-dithering |
| `uDevContrast` | mult | 1 | 0.1–5 | Develop's own contrast, on top of the image grade |
| `uCrossOn` / `uCrossSize` / `uCrossPos` | — | 1 / 0.075 / (0.62,0.58) | — | aviation-red registration cross |
| `uPress` / `uPressFalloff` | — | 0.4 / 2.2 | — | **LEGACY / dead** — kept declared but unread; superseded by the cursor uniforms |
| `uMouse` / `uMouseStrength` | runtime | (0,0) / 0 | — | cursor position + movement-decayed strength (scene.ts) |
| `uMouseDir` | runtime | (0,1) | — | normalised pointer motion direction (unit vec2); lerped + renormalised each frame; stretch collapses to circle when `uMouseStrength = 0` |
| `uRes` / `uTime` / `uEnergy` / `uScrollVel` | runtime | — | — | system |

## Cursor modes (`uCursorMode`)

One shared per-cell influence scalar `infl = max(uMouseStrength, uHold) * exp(-md * uCursorRadius)`,
built only from `p` (one value per cell) — never varies `cell`/`cellId` spatially (that shatters the grid).

- **0 Off** — no effect.
- **1 Clear** (default) — `lum += amp·infl`: lifts ink, opens paper under the cursor.
- **2 Ink** — `lum -= amp·infl` + thickens `wEff`: presses denser, swollen marks in.
- **3 Bias** — subtracts from the Bayer `threshold`: marks fill in the screen's own dot order.
- **4 Negative** — local polarity flip via a `smoothstep(uCursorEdge, …)` disc.
- **5 Develop** — local resolve that lives **inside the dither** (not a photo overlay): the source
  is graded — **Pop** (`uDevSharp`, 4-tap unsharp), **Saturation** (`uDevSat`), **Colorize**
  (`uDevColor` blends mono↔colour) — and then **re-dithered at `uDevCell`** detail (**Detail**).
  **Stage** (`uDevStage`) ramps the finer dither in, **Resolve** (`uDevResolve`) caps how fully it
  replaces the base marks. So a press develops into a finer, fuller **dither** of the photo —
  manipulating the source + marks directly. The only smooth-photo path is the global **Reveal**
  (applied as a separate `mix()`, last).

## Behaviours

- **Reveal** (`uReveal`, GSAP-tweened in `artefact.ts` `rev`): crossfades to the **true-colour
  photo in natural light** — no invert/brightness/contrast on the revealed source, so it never
  passes through a negative — while the cell count ramps geometrically (`REVEAL_CELL_MULT`).
- **Image → image** is a true crossfade through `uImage2`/`uXfade` (two slots, promote on complete);
  **field ↔ image** uses `uImageOn`. No procedural-field flash between photos.
- **Invert** is an Off / On / **Auto** control (`look.invertMode`), resolving to `uInvert`. Auto
  (default) is **palette-based**: invert when `paperLum < inkLum` (dark-paper stock), so a natural
  photo reads positive on any colorway with no manual toggling. Polarity is a *palette* property,
  not an image one — an image-histogram heuristic (designed via workflow) was rejected because it
  renders dark photos as negatives. A dev-bar status row shows the Auto decision + stock.
- **Motion** (DOM/GSAP, not a uniform): all dither/reveal tweens share one ease + duration via the
  artefact `EASES` list + `motion` (dev-bar Motion group). Default **quint ease-out, 0.6s**. The
  Motion group also carries **FPS** — Cine = `gsap.ticker.fps(24)`, **Commo** = 17 (deliberately
  choppy retro cadence), Fluid = uncapped (default Fluid; the ticker drives the whole render loop) —
  and a **live ease preview**: an inline SVG of
  `gsap.parseEase(selected)` with a playhead dot looping at the chosen duration.
- **Cloud scroll** (`uCloudSpeed`): cloud fade (mode 2) scrolls sideways via a continuous horizontal
  fbm offset (`+ vec2(uTime·uCloudSpeed, 0)`) — seamless / never-repeating, decoupled from `uDrift`.
  Dev-bar Screen group: **Cloud anim** toggle + **Cloud speed**; push `uCloudSpeed = anim ? speed : 0`.
- **Dev-bar layout**: a single floating **vertical panel** — collapsible (grip click / backtick) and
  **free-draggable** anywhere by its grip header (position persisted as `{x,y}`, re-clamped on
  restore). One scrolling column of all groups, so it never wraps. Settings export via Output >
  **Copy JSON** (full `{look, motion}` snapshot to clipboard, prompt() fallback).

## Palette families (54)

**Neon noir** (36–40), **Earth/botanical** (41–45), **Vapor/Y2K** (46–49), **Bold drench** (50–53).

## Changelog

Newest first. Log EVERY shading change here.

### 2026-06-30
- **Cloud noise types + X/Y size**: `uNoiseType` (FBM / Ridged-Musgrave / Voronoi via `fadeNoise()`)
  and `uFadeScaleY` (independent vertical cloud frequency) — new **Cloud** dev-bar group (split from
  Screen) carrying Cloud X/Y, Noise, anim, speed, Fade X/Y; hidden when Fade = Off.
- **Develop group + own B/C**: develop controls moved to a dedicated **Develop** group (split from
  Cursor), hidden unless Mode = Develop; added `uDevBright`/`uDevContrast` (develop-region brightness
  + contrast, on top of the image grade).
- **Hover-to-change** toggle (DOM, beside Reveal): when on, hovering a menu item swaps the image.
- **Plate border** now uses the colorway **ink** colour (was white) at **15px** (was 25px).
- **Cursor field view** (`uCursorView`, Output > **Show cursor field**): renders raw `infl` as
  grayscale (white = peak influence, black = none), bypassing dither and colour — shows the
  ellipse shape, orientation, and falloff directly. Same pattern as `uMaskView` / `uImageState`.
- **Velocity-aware cursor ellipse**: the isotropic influence disc
  `infl = max(uMouseStrength,uHold)·exp(-md·uCursorRadius)` is now an ellipse oriented along the
  pointer's motion vector. New uniform `uMouseDir` (unit vec2, runtime, scene.ts) carries the
  normalised direction. Stretch = `1.0 + 1.5·uMouseStrength` (1.0 still → ~3.1 at full speed);
  decays to a circle automatically when `uMouseStrength → 0` (Hold mode stays circular). Applies
  to all cursor modes (Clear / Ink / Bias / Negative / Develop) via the shared `md` computation.
  No new dev-bar control — stretch is content-derived from existing speed tracking.
- **Fade mask viewer + movable anchor**: `uMaskView` (Output > **Show fade mask**) renders the raw
  `cov` as grayscale so the gradient/cloud shape is directly visible; `uFadePos` (Screen > **Fade X /
  Fade Y**) moves where the dissolve originates (default 0,0 = bottom-left).
- **Dev-bar info-circles**: every control label carries a hover ⓘ with concise helper text (fixed
  tooltip, `HELP` map in `artefact.ts`); action buttons get the same on hover.
- **Develop is now integrated, not an overlay**: removed the smooth photo `devTarget` cross-fade.
  Develop grades the source (Pop/Saturation/Colorize) then **re-dithers it** at `uDevCell`; Stage
  ramps it in, Resolve caps how fully the fine dither replaces the base marks. The only smooth-photo
  path is global Reveal. (Was: finer grain → faded a graded photo on top.)
- **Full-colour never inverts**: dropped `uInvert` from the colour dither paths (main + fine + image
  state); the **Invert + Auto rows hide while Full colour is on**. `uInvert` is now duotone-only.
- **Image canvas fits the source's native aspect**: `#gl` width is set in JS to `plateHeight ×
  imgAspect` (capped to 90% frame width), so photos show at original proportions / fill further
  right instead of being cover-cropped into the fixed CSS box. Reverts to CSS default for the field.
- **Dev bar → floating vertical panel**: replaced the bar↔rail dock toggle with one collapsible,
  **free-draggable** vertical panel (grip header drags it anywhere; position persisted + clamped).
  Output **Copy values → Copy JSON** now exports a full `{look, motion}` snapshot (clipboard +
  prompt fallback).
- **Cloud dissolve now stippled through the dither** (`step(bayer4(cellId), cov)`) — the cloud fade
  drops cells in Bayer order, affecting the dither pixels instead of overlaying a smooth alpha.
- **Mark brightness** `uMarkBright` (−1–1, def 0): brightens/darkens the dither mark colour itself
  (palette ink / colour dot), separate from `uImageBrightness` (source). Base + develop, duotone + colour.
- **Commo FPS 50 → 17** (deliberately choppy retro cadence).
- **Pixel-cross custom cursor** + click "detonation" (DOM/GSAP) — a box-shadow crosshair tracks the
  pointer (native hidden); clicking the plate bursts a ring of dither pixels + an elastic crosshair punch.
- **Stepper values are drag-to-scrub** (drag the number ≈6px/step), reusing the clamped dec/inc.
- **Wider ranges** across the artefact dev bar: Cell 16–600, Cloud 0.5–20, Cloud speed 0–2, Levels
  2–16, Brightness ±1, Contrast 0.1–5, cursor Strength 0–5 / Radius 0.2–16 / Hold 0–3 / Edge 0–2,
  Detail 40–3000, Stage 0–1, Saturation 0–4, Pop 0–3, Duration 0.05–5s. (Rig sliders keep their own.)
- **FPS preset "Commo"** (50fps — the PAL Commodore-64 vertical refresh; NTSC C64 was ~59.8) added
  alongside Fluid / Cine.
- **Motif surfaced contextually** in the Colour group (full-colour) and Cursor group (Develop),
  synced with the Screen Motif — the shader already applied `uMotif` in both paths.
- **Develop fine-tuning** — new uniforms `uDevStage` (grain→photo handoff, def 0.45, 0.1–0.9),
  `uDevResolve` (develop depth, def 1), `uDevSat` (saturation, def 1, 0–2), `uDevSharp` (4-tap
  unsharp Pop, def 0). `uDevColor` is now a **0–1 Colorize amount** (was 0/1 toggle). `uDevCell`
  range 120→**1200** (step 24). The two hardcoded develop smoothsteps are now driven by `uDevStage`;
  Develop resolves to its OWN colour-graded target (colorize/sat/pop), separated from the global
  Reveal (true source). Dev-bar Cursor group gains Stage/Resolve/Saturation/Pop + Colorize stepper.
- **Animated cloud** — `uCloudSpeed` (def 0.05, 0–0.5): cloud fade (mode 2) scrolls sideways via a
  continuous fbm horizontal offset (seamless, never-repeating), decoupled from `uDrift`. Screen
  group: Cloud anim toggle + Cloud speed.
- **FPS cadence** — Motion group Cine (24fps) / Fluid (uncapped) toggle via `gsap.ticker.fps()`.
- **Ease preview** — live inline-SVG graph of the selected GSAP ease with a real-time playhead dot.
- **Dev-bar layout toggle** — horizontal bar ↔ vertical side rail (full-height single-column scroll,
  grip-drag to dock left/right, persisted) — fixes horizontal wrap/resize at high control counts.

### 2026-06-29
- **Auto invert reintroduced** as Off/On/**Auto** (`look.invertMode`, default Auto). Auto is
  palette-based (`paperLum < inkLum` → invert) — correct natural polarity on every colorway; a
  dev-bar status row reports it. NOTE: a workflow-designed image-histogram ("mass-to-ground")
  heuristic was built and then REJECTED — it inverts dark photos (renders them as negatives);
  natural polarity is a palette property, not an image one.
- **Detail by cell count.** `uDevFine` (multiplier) → `uDevCell` (absolute cell count, same units
  as `uCell`); Develop fine cell = `uRes.y / uDevCell`. Default 450, range 120–960 step 12.
- **Dev bar:** clipping-proof layout — divisor-of-6 column counts (6/3/2/1 by breakpoint), viewport
  height cap + internal scroll. Develop **Colorize** toggle (`uDevColor`). Contextual controls hide
  (not dim). Merged Marks+Edge → "Screen".
- **Motion controls** — live Ease (cubic/quart/quint/expo/circ out, quint in-out, back out) +
  Duration; default quint ease-out 0.6s (was symmetric quad).
- **+30 colorways → 54** (six new families); fixed Bone (index 0) shader fall-through to Sepia.
- **Cursor effect modes** (Off/Clear/Ink/Bias/Negative/Develop) + Develop local cell-count increase.
- **Reveal → natural-light** (removed the `effInvert` reveal ramp that passed through a negative).
- **Image→image crossfade** via a second texture slot (`uImage2`/`uXfade`) — no field flash.
- **Auto image polarity** (`imgInv` by palette paper luminance) added, then **reverted** ("no auto").
- **Reveal/depixel sync** — geometric cell ramp so the marks resolve in step with the crossfade.
- **Inverted-image white-out @ reveal** fix.
